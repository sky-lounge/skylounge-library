  #     ## Versioning semantics
  #     Deployed version state is tracked in the repository using two files: `.github/development-version.txt` and `.github/production-version.txt` for the development and production deployments respectively. Version values correspond to the commit SHA of the last change made in development that triggered the development workflow. This enables easy tracking of deployed features.

  #     The development version is set automatically in the development workflow after integration tests complete successfully. The single job in this workflow copies the development SHA to the production version file `.github/production-version.txt`. This triggers the execution of the production workflow to complete the deployment.

  #     ## Rollback
  #     Rollback can be completed by updating the `.github/production-version.txt` file to the SHA of the version you would like to roll back to. This will trigger the production workflow to complete the rollback.
